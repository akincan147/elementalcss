# Bootstrap Styles Optimization

I am undertaking a comprehensive optimization of Bootstrap styles with a focus on enhancing readability, stability, and consistency across all variables. This process includes:

Restructuring the structural comprehensibility of styles caused by Sass.

Enhancing Color Variables: Making color variables more intuitive and customizable, while addressing any mixed or disorganized color assignments. The goal is to achieve a streamlined, user-friendly design system.
