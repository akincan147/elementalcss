I'm undertaking a comprehensive optimization of Bootstrap styles, focusing on enhancing readability, stability, and consistency across variables. This involves restructuring the Sass architecture, revising and refining all styles to ensure a cohesive and organized framework. Additionally, I'm making color variables more intuitive and customizable, addressing any mixed or disorganized color assignments to achieve a streamlined and user-friendly design system.

I am currently working on integrating everything within the style.css file. When everything is complete, the project directory will be finished and organized.
